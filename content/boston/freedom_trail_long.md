# Freedom Trail - Long Tour

## Origins of the Freedom Trail

The Freedom Trail, one of Boston's most beloved attractions, was conceived in 1951 when local journalist William Schofield of the Boston Herald-Traveler proposed creating a pedestrian trail to connect important local historic sites. Boston was facing economic challenges at the time, and Schofield believed that highlighting the city's rich history could boost tourism and local pride.

Boston's mayor John Hynes enthusiastically supported the idea, and the city marked out the first version of the trail later that year. The original trail was marked simply with black paint, but this was later replaced with the now-iconic red brick line embedded in the sidewalk, making it easy for visitors to follow the path through the city.

The trail was an immediate success, drawing visitors eager to walk in the footsteps of America's founding fathers. In 1964, the Freedom Trail Foundation was established to help preserve and promote the trail, working in partnership with the City of Boston and the National Park Service.

## The 16 Official Sites

The Freedom Trail connects 16 historically significant sites, each with its own unique story to tell about Boston's role in the founding of America:

### 1. Boston Common (1634)

The trail begins at America's oldest public park, established in 1634. Originally used as a common pasture for grazing cattle, it later served as a camp for British troops prior to the Revolution. The Common has witnessed countless historic events, including anti-slavery speeches, civil rights rallies, and Vietnam War protests. The Central Burying Ground, established in 1756, contains the graves of notable figures including composer William Billings and painter Gilbert Stuart.

### 2. Massachusetts State House (1798)

Designed by Charles Bulfinch, America's first professional architect, the "new" State House features a distinctive dome that was originally made of wood. In 1802, it was covered with copper by Paul Revere's company, and in 1874, it was gilded with 23-karat gold leaf. The building houses the state legislature and the governor's offices. Inside, the Hall of Flags displays military flags from Massachusetts regiments, and the Sacred Cod, a wooden carving, hangs in the House of Representatives as a symbol of the importance of the fishing industry to the state's economy.

### 3. Park Street Church (1809)

This church, with its 217-foot steeple that was once the first landmark travelers saw when approaching Boston, has been a center of social activism since its founding. In 1829, William Lloyd Garrison delivered his first anti-slavery speech here. The hymn "America" ("My Country, 'Tis of Thee") was first sung here on July 4, 1831. The church basement was used to store gunpowder during the War of 1812, earning the area the nickname "Brimstone Corner."

### 4. Granary Burying Ground (1660)

Named for the grain storage building that once stood nearby, this is Boston's third-oldest cemetery and the final resting place of many Revolutionary heroes. Notable graves include those of John Hancock, Samuel Adams, and Robert Treat Paine (all signers of the Declaration of Independence), Paul Revere, the victims of the Boston Massacre, and Benjamin Franklin's parents. The cemetery contains approximately 2,300 grave markers, though it's estimated that over 5,000 people are buried here.

### 5. King's Chapel and Burying Ground (1686 and 1630)

The burying ground is Boston's oldest cemetery, established in 1630. Notable burials include Massachusetts' first governor, John Winthrop, and Mary Chilton, believed to be the first woman to step off the Mayflower. The chapel itself, built in 1754, was the first Anglican church in New England. After the Revolution, it became the first Unitarian church in America. The bell, cast by Paul Revere in 1816, cracked while being rung and now has a distinctive sound that Bostonians have grown to love.

### 6. Boston Latin School Site/Benjamin Franklin Statue (1635)

A statue of Benjamin Franklin marks the site of Boston Latin School, America's first public school, established in 1635. Franklin attended the school but dropped out at age 10. Despite this, he became one of America's most accomplished citizens—a writer, publisher, scientist, inventor, diplomat, and signer of both the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution. The school itself still exists but moved to a different location in the Fenway neighborhood.

### 7. Old Corner Bookstore (1718)

Originally built as an apothecary shop and residence after the Great Fire of 1711, this building became the Old Corner Bookstore in 1832. Under the ownership of publishers Ticknor and Fields, it was the center of literary Boston in the mid-19th century, publishing works by Thoreau, Hawthorne, Longfellow, Stowe, Emerson, and other prominent American writers who often gathered here. Today, it houses a Chipotle restaurant but remains an important architectural landmark as one of the oldest brick structures in Boston.

### 8. Old South Meeting House (1729)

This was the largest building in colonial Boston and served as both a church and a meeting place. On December 16, 1773, over 5,000 colonists gathered here to protest the British tea tax. When negotiations failed, Samuel Adams gave a signal that began the Boston Tea Party. The British later used the building as a riding school during their occupation of Boston. In 1876, it was saved from demolition by a group of determined women, becoming one of the first historic preservation victories in America.

### 9. Old State House (1713)

This building served as the seat of colonial and state government until 1798. On July 18, 1776, the Declaration of Independence was read from its balcony to the citizens of Boston. The distinctive lion and unicorn on the roof are replicas of the originals, which were torn down and burned during the Revolution as symbols of royal authority. The Boston Massacre occurred just outside this building on March 5, 1770, when British soldiers fired into a crowd, killing five colonists. This event, skillfully propagandized by patriots like Samuel Adams and Paul Revere, helped fuel revolutionary sentiment.

### 10. Boston Massacre Site (1770)

A circular stone marker in the street indicates where five colonists were killed by British soldiers on March 5, 1770. The confrontation began when a wigmaker's apprentice accused a British officer of not paying his bill, leading to an escalating argument. A crowd gathered, throwing snowballs and insults at the soldiers. In the confusion, the soldiers fired into the crowd, killing Crispus Attucks (a sailor of African and Native American descent), Samuel Gray, James Caldwell, Samuel Maverick, and Patrick Carr. John Adams, though a patriot, defended the British soldiers at their trial, demonstrating his belief in the rule of law and fair trials.

### 11. Faneuil Hall (1742)

Often called the "Cradle of Liberty," this building was a gift to the city from wealthy merchant Peter Faneuil. The first-floor marketplace has been in continuous operation since 1742, making it America's oldest continuously operating market. The second-floor meeting hall hosted numerous town meetings and revolutionary debates. Speakers here included Samuel Adams, James Otis, and others who advocated for independence from Britain. The building's grasshopper weathervane, created by Shem Drowne, has become an iconic symbol of Boston.

### 12. Paul Revere House (1680)

This modest wooden home is downtown Boston's oldest building and the only remaining 17th-century residence in the city center. Paul Revere lived here from 1770 to 1800, including the period of his famous midnight ride on April 18, 1775, when he warned colonists that British troops were marching to Lexington and Concord. Built around 1680, the house was already nearly 100 years old when Revere purchased it. After passing through various owners and uses, including a time as a cigar factory and tenement housing for immigrants, it was purchased and restored as a museum in 1908, making it one of the earliest historic house museums in the country.

### 13. Old North Church (1723)

Boston's oldest surviving church building is famous for its role in Paul Revere's midnight ride. On the evening of April 18, 1775, church sexton Robert Newman climbed the steeple and hung two lanterns as a signal that the British were approaching by sea across the Charles River rather than by land—"One if by land, two if by sea." This warning allowed the colonial militias to prepare for the battles of Lexington and Concord, which began the American Revolution. The church's 175-foot steeple, the tallest in Boston at the time, made it an ideal location for sending such a signal. Inside, the church retains its original "box pews," which families would purchase and decorate according to their tastes.

### 14. Copp's Hill Burying Ground (1659)

Boston's second-oldest cemetery contains the remains of many early Bostonians, including thousands of artisans, craftspeople, and merchants who lived in the North End. Notable burials include Puritan ministers Cotton and Increase Mather, Robert Newman (who hung the lanterns in the Old North Church), and Prince Hall, a free Black man who founded the first African American Masonic lodge in the United States. During the Battle of Bunker Hill, British soldiers used the high ground of the cemetery to place their cannons for firing on Charlestown. Some gravestones still bear the marks of British musket balls, as soldiers used them for target practice.

### 15. USS Constitution (1797)

Nicknamed "Old Ironsides" during the War of 1812 when British cannonballs appeared to bounce off her oak hull, the USS Constitution is the oldest commissioned warship afloat in the world. Built in Boston and launched in 1797, she was one of the first six frigates of the U.S. Navy, authorized by Congress to protect American merchant ships from Barbary pirates and later from British interference. The ship never lost a battle and captured or destroyed 33 enemy vessels. Today, she is crewed by active-duty U.S. Navy sailors who provide tours and fire her cannons for special occasions. Every 20 years, the Constitution is taken into dry dock for major restoration work to preserve her for future generations.

### 16. Bunker Hill Monument (1843)

The trail ends at this 221-foot granite obelisk commemorating the Battle of Bunker Hill, which was actually fought primarily on nearby Breed's Hill on June 17, 1775. Although the British technically won this battle, they suffered heavy casualties—226 dead and over 800 wounded, compared to about 140 dead and 300 wounded on the American side. The American commander, Colonel William Prescott, reportedly told his men, "Don't fire until you see the whites of their eyes," to conserve their limited ammunition. The monument took 17 years to complete, with the cornerstone laid by the Marquis de Lafayette in 1825 and the dedication ceremony in 1843 attended by President John Tyler and 100,000 spectators. Visitors can climb the 294 steps to the top for panoramic views of Boston.

## Walking the Trail Today

Today, over 4 million people walk some or all of the Freedom Trail each year. The complete 2.5-mile trail typically takes 2-3 hours to walk, though many visitors spend an entire day exploring the sites in depth. The red brick or painted line makes the route easy to follow, and medallions embedded in the sidewalk mark each official site.

The trail passes through diverse Boston neighborhoods, from the elegant Beacon Hill with its gas lamps and brick sidewalks, through the bustling downtown and financial district, to the narrow streets of the North End (Boston's Little Italy), and finally across the Charles River to Charlestown.

Guided tours are available from the Freedom Trail Foundation, with costumed guides portraying historical figures from the Revolutionary era. These tours bring history to life with stories, anecdotes, and historical context that might otherwise be missed by independent visitors.

## Beyond the Official Trail

While the official Freedom Trail includes 16 sites, many other historic locations lie just steps away from the red line. These include the Black Heritage Trail, which explores Boston's role in the abolitionist movement and the history of its free Black community; the Irish Heritage Trail; and numerous historic churches, homes, and museums that tell the broader story of Boston's development from a colonial outpost to a modern city.

The Freedom Trail stands as a living museum of American history, allowing visitors to literally walk in the footsteps of the founding fathers and experience the places where the ideals of American liberty and self-government took shape. As John Adams wrote in 1777, "The Revolution was in the minds and hearts of the people," and nowhere is this more evident than along Boston's Freedom Trail.
