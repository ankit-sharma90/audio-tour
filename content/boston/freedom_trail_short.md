# Freedom Trail - Short Tour

The Freedom Trail is a 2.5-mile-long path through downtown Boston that passes by 16 locations significant to the history of the United States. Marked largely with brick, it winds from Boston Common in downtown Boston to the Bunker Hill Monument in Charlestown.

Created in 1951, the trail was the brainchild of local journalist William Schofield, who suggested creating a pedestrian trail to link important local landmarks. Mayor John Hynes embraced the idea, and the city established the first marked route that same year.

The trail takes visitors to historic churches, meeting houses, burying grounds, parks, a ship, and historic markers that tell the story of the American Revolution and beyond. Each site has been preserved and many still operate as they have for centuries.

Among the most notable stops are the Massachusetts State House with its distinctive gold dome, the Old South Meeting House where the Boston Tea Party was planned, the site of the Boston Massacre, Paul Revere's House, and the USS Constitution, the oldest commissioned warship afloat in the world.

The Freedom Trail Foundation, established in 1964, helps preserve and promote the trail. Today, over 4 million people walk the Freedom Trail each year, making it one of Boston's most popular tourist attractions.

Walking the trail offers not just a journey through American history, but also a pleasant way to explore different Boston neighborhoods, from the bustling downtown and financial district to the charming narrow streets of the North End and finally to Charlestown with its views of Boston Harbor.
