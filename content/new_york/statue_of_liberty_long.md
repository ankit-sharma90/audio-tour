# Statue of Liberty - Long Tour

## Origins and Conception

The story of the Statue of Liberty begins in the aftermath of the American Civil War. In 1865, French historian Édouard de Laboulaye proposed the idea of presenting a monument to the United States as a gift from the people of France. This gift would celebrate the centennial of American independence while also commemorating the alliance between France and America during the Revolutionary War. Additionally, it would serve as a subtle criticism of the authoritarian regime of Napoleon III in France.

Frédéric Auguste Bartholdi, a French sculptor, was commissioned to design the statue with a completion date of 1876, coinciding with America's centennial celebrations. Bartholdi's vision was of a colossal neoclassical sculpture of Libertas, the Roman goddess of freedom, holding a torch and tablet. The tablet would be inscribed with "JULY IV MDCCLXXVI" (July 4, 1776), the date of the American Declaration of Independence.

## Design and Construction

The statue's internal structure was designed by Gustave Eiffel, who would later become famous for the Eiffel Tower. Eiffel created an innovative iron framework that would support the copper skin while allowing for thermal expansion and contraction, a critical consideration for an outdoor monument of this size.

Construction began in France in 1875. The statue was built from the ground up, starting with the right arm and torch, which were exhibited at the Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia in 1876 and in New York's Madison Square Park from 1876 to 1882 to raise funds for the pedestal.

The statue's copper skin is only 3/32 of an inch thick (about 2.4 millimeters), but is incredibly durable. The copper sheets were hammered into shape by hand using a technique called repoussé. This involved hammering the copper sheets against wooden molds to create the desired shape. The entire statue contains 62,000 pounds (28,000 kg) of copper and 250,000 pounds (113,000 kg) of steel.

## Symbolism in Detail

Every aspect of the Statue of Liberty carries symbolic meaning:

- The broken chains at her feet represent freedom from oppression and tyranny.
- The seven spikes on her crown represent the seven continents and seas, symbolizing universal liberty.
- The torch represents enlightenment, lighting the path to freedom.
- The tablet she holds inscribed with July 4, 1776, represents the rule of law.
- Her classical Roman features and robes connect American liberty to ancient republican ideals.
- Her right foot is raised, symbolizing forward movement, suggesting that liberty is not static but always advancing.

## The Pedestal and Funding Challenges

While France was responsible for creating the statue itself, the United States was tasked with providing the pedestal. This proved challenging, as fundraising efforts stalled. The situation became so dire that by 1884, work on the pedestal had to be suspended due to lack of funds.

Publisher Joseph Pulitzer came to the rescue through his newspaper, The World. He launched a fundraising campaign, promising to print the name of every contributor, regardless of the amount donated. This strategy was remarkably successful, raising over $100,000 (equivalent to about $2.3 million today) from more than 120,000 donors, most of whom gave less than a dollar.

The pedestal was designed by American architect Richard Morris Hunt in the neoclassical style. It stands 89 feet tall and is made of concrete faced with granite. The cornerstone was laid in 1884, and the pedestal was completed in April 1886.

## Assembly in America

The statue was completed in France in July 1884 and disassembled into 350 pieces, packed in 214 crates, and shipped to New York aboard the French frigate Isère, which arrived in New York Harbor on June 17, 1885. The reassembly of the statue on its pedestal took four months.

On October 28, 1886, President Grover Cleveland dedicated the Statue of Liberty before thousands of spectators. Ironically, women were not allowed to attend the dedication ceremony, despite the statue being a female figure representing liberty. Suffragettes protested this decision by chartering a boat and circling the island during the ceremony.

## Emma Lazarus and "The New Colossus"

In 1883, American poet Emma Lazarus wrote "The New Colossus" to help raise money for the pedestal. The sonnet, particularly its famous lines "Give me your tired, your poor, Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free," transformed the statue's meaning, adding the dimension of welcoming immigrants to its symbolism of liberty and freedom.

However, the poem wasn't actually mounted on the pedestal until 1903, sixteen years after Lazarus's death, when her friend Georgina Schuyler led an effort to memorialize the poem and its connection to the statue.

## The Statue as an Immigration Symbol

While the statue was not originally conceived as a symbol of immigration, it quickly took on this meaning. The statue's location in New York Harbor made it the first glimpse of America for millions of immigrants arriving at nearby Ellis Island, which operated as the nation's busiest immigration station from 1892 to 1954.

For these newcomers, the statue represented the promise of a new life in America, a land of opportunity and freedom from persecution. Many immigrants reported weeping at their first sight of the statue, overwhelmed by the realization that they had finally reached America.

## Restorations and Renovations

Over the decades, the Statue of Liberty has undergone several major restorations:

In the 1930s, the statue was placed under the care of the National Park Service, and minor renovations were made.

By the early 1980s, the statue had severely deteriorated. French and American engineers determined that the statue's internal iron framework was corroding where it contacted the copper skin, threatening the statue's structural integrity. This galvanic corrosion occurred because the copper and iron created an electrochemical reaction when in contact with each other, especially in the presence of saltwater air.

From 1984 to 1986, the statue underwent an extensive $87 million restoration in preparation for its centennial. The iron framework was replaced with stainless steel bars, and the torch, which had been modified over the years and had suffered water damage, was replaced with a new copper torch covered in 24-karat gold leaf.

The statue was reopened to the public during Liberty Weekend, July 4–6, 1986, which celebrated its centennial.

## The Statue Today

Today, the Statue of Liberty remains one of America's most recognizable landmarks and a powerful symbol of freedom worldwide. It attracts approximately 4 million visitors annually.

After the September 11, 2001 attacks, the statue was closed to the public for security reasons. The pedestal reopened in 2004, but the statue remained closed until July 4, 2009, when the crown was reopened to the public. Access is limited to 240 people per day, with advance reservations required.

In 2012, Hurricane Sandy flooded Liberty Island, damaging facilities but leaving the statue itself unharmed. The island reopened on July 4, 2013, following repairs.

The Statue of Liberty continues to evolve in its meaning while remaining a steadfast symbol of freedom, democracy, and opportunity—a beacon of hope for people around the world.
