# Statue of Liberty - Short Tour

Standing proudly in New York Harbor, the Statue of Liberty has welcomed millions of immigrants to America since 1886. This colossal neoclassical sculpture was a gift from France to the United States, symbolizing freedom and democracy.

Designed by French sculptor Frédéric Auguste Bartholdi, the statue depicts Libertas, the Roman goddess of liberty, holding a torch above her head with her right hand and carrying a tabula ansata (a tablet evoking the law) in her left hand, upon which is inscribed July 4, 1776, the date of the American Declaration of Independence.

The statue stands at an impressive height of 305 feet from ground level to the tip of the torch, including the pedestal. The copper statue itself is 151 feet tall and weighs 450,000 pounds. The seven rays on her crown represent the seven continents and seas.

Construction began in France in 1875, and the completed statue was disassembled, packed in crates, and shipped to New York in 1885. It was reassembled on Liberty Island and dedicated on October 28, 1886.

Over the years, the statue has undergone several restorations, most notably for the American Bicentennial in 1976 and again for its centennial in 1986. The statue's original copper color has changed to the green patina we see today due to oxidation of the copper skin.

Today, the Statue of Liberty remains one of America's most iconic landmarks, attracting millions of visitors each year who come to marvel at this symbol of freedom and opportunity.
