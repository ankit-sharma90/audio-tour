1. **Historically accurate** information about the landmark
2. **Engaging storytelling** that brings the landmark to life
3. **Cultural context** explaining the landmark's significance
4. **Interesting facts** that might not be widely known
5. **Clear structure** with headings and sections (especially in the long version)
