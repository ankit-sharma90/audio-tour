# Lombard Street: San Francisco's Crooked Wonder

## Introduction

Welcome to Lombard Street, one of San Francisco's most photographed and visited landmarks. While many refer to it as "the crookedest street in the world," this famous one-block section between Hyde and Leavenworth streets is actually the second most winding street in the city—Vermont Street in the Potrero Hill neighborhood technically has more curves. Nevertheless, Lombard Street's eight sharp hairpin turns, elegant brick paving, and carefully manicured gardens have made it an enduring symbol of San Francisco's charm and ingenuity.

## The Birth of a Crooked Icon

In the early 1920s, Lombard Street presented a significant problem for San Francisco's growing population. The natural grade of this section was an incredibly steep 27% incline—far too dangerous for the early automobiles of that era to navigate safely. Local resident Carl Henry, who owned property on the street, proposed an innovative solution in 1922: transform the straight, steep road into a series of switchbacks, similar to those used on mountain roads.

City engineer Clyde Healy designed the new street pattern with eight tight turns that reduced the effective grade to a more manageable 16%. Construction was completed in 1923, creating the zigzag pattern we see today. The design was purely practical—to make the hill navigable—but inadvertently created what would become one of the city's most beloved attractions.

## Architectural and Horticultural Beauty

What makes Lombard Street truly special isn't just its curves but the complete aesthetic package. The roadway is paved with distinctive red bricks, chosen for both their beauty and their ability to provide better traction for vehicles. On either side of the winding road, meticulously maintained gardens showcase over 2,000 plants, with hydrangeas being the signature flower.

The gardens weren't part of the original design but were added in the 1940s by resident Peter Bercut, who began the tradition of beautiful landscaping that continues today. The plants are selected to provide color year-round, with seasonal rotations ensuring the street always looks its best.

Framing this botanical display are stunning examples of early 20th-century architecture. Most of the homes along this section were built between 1900 and 1930, representing various styles including Edwardian, Arts and Crafts, and Mediterranean Revival. The most famous residence is number 1000 Lombard, a neoclassical mansion that has appeared in several films and television shows.

## Lombard Street in Popular Culture

Speaking of films, Lombard Street has made numerous appearances in popular media. Alfred Hitchcock featured it in his 1958 thriller "Vertigo," while it served as a dramatic chase location in the 1968 action film "Bullitt" starring Steve McQueen. More recently, it appeared in the 2003 remake of "The Italian Job" and has been featured in countless television shows, commercials, and music videos.

The street has also become a staple of video games set in San Francisco, appearing in titles like "Driver," "Midtown Madness," and "Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas," where players can experience the thrill of navigating its curves virtually.

## Living on the Crookedest Street

While millions marvel at Lombard Street's unique design, it's easy to forget that this is actually a residential street where people live their everyday lives. The approximately 20 homes along this famous block are some of the most expensive in the city, with property values often exceeding $4 million.

Residents face unique challenges, including dealing with the estimated two million tourists who visit annually. During summer months, up to 17,000 vehicles may drive down the crooked section each weekend day, creating a constant stream of traffic from 10 AM until well after sunset.

In recent years, residents have worked with the city to address congestion issues. Various solutions have been proposed, including reservation systems, paid access, or even closing the street to non-resident vehicles entirely. In 2019, state legislation was introduced that would have allowed the city to implement a toll and reservation system, though it ultimately wasn't enacted.

## Engineering Marvel

From an engineering perspective, Lombard Street represents a creative solution to a common problem in San Francisco—how to build a functional city on extremely hilly terrain. The switchback design effectively reduces the grade while the brick paving provides necessary traction. Drainage systems built into the curves prevent rainwater from pooling, while the concrete walls that form the planting beds also serve as retaining structures to prevent erosion.

The street's design has proven remarkably durable. Despite nearly a century of continuous use and minimal structural modifications, the basic engineering remains sound. Maintenance crews regularly replace bricks and repair mortar, but the fundamental design has withstood the test of time.

## Experiencing Lombard Street

Visitors experience Lombard Street in several ways. Many choose to drive down the crooked section, a journey that takes about 5 minutes due to the 5 mph speed limit and frequent traffic backups. Others prefer to walk up or down the stairs that flank the roadway, offering excellent photo opportunities.

For the best views, approach from the bottom at Leavenworth Street, where you can capture the entire zigzag pattern in one frame. Alternatively, stand at the top at Hyde Street for spectacular vistas of the city and bay beyond the curves. The Hyde Street cable car line stops at the top of Lombard, making it a convenient way to arrive.

Morning visits offer the best lighting for photography, while evening brings a magical quality as the street lights illuminate the curves. Spring and summer showcase the hydrangeas in full bloom, adding vibrant blues and purples to your photos.

## Beyond the Crooked Block

While the famous curved section gets all the attention, Lombard Street actually stretches across the entire width of San Francisco. Beginning at the Presidio in the west, it runs through the Marina District, Russian Hill (where the crooked section is located), and Telegraph Hill before ending at The Embarcadero.

Each section has its own character. The Marina portion features beautiful Art Deco apartment buildings, while the eastern sections offer glimpses of the bay. If you have time, consider exploring more of this historic thoroughfare to experience different facets of San Francisco beyond the famous curves.

## Conclusion

Lombard Street stands as a testament to San Francisco's creative problem-solving and ability to transform practical solutions into beloved landmarks. What began as a simple traffic engineering project has evolved into one of the city's most recognizable symbols, drawing visitors from around the world.

As you navigate its curves—whether by car, on foot, or simply through photographs—you're participating in a century-old tradition of appreciating this unique intersection of engineering, architecture, and natural beauty. In a city known for its hills, Lombard Street represents the quintessential San Francisco response: don't flatten the hill, find a beautiful way to work with it.
