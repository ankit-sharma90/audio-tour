# Alcatraz Island

Alcatraz Island, sitting ominously in San Francisco Bay, holds a fascinating history that spans far beyond its notorious 29 years as a federal penitentiary. Originally named "La Isla de los Alcatraces" (Island of the Pelicans) by Spanish explorers, this 22-acre rock has served multiple purposes throughout American history, each layer adding to its mystique and significance.

## Early History

Long before European settlers arrived, the island was used by indigenous peoples, particularly the Ohlone, who visited it to collect bird eggs and seafood. However, they avoided staying overnight, believing the island to be inhabited by evil spirits.

Spanish explorer Juan Manuel de Ayala charted San Francisco Bay in 1775 and named the island "La Isla de los Alcatraces" due to the large population of brown pelicans nesting there. This was later anglicized to "Alcatraz."

## Military Fortress

Following the Mexican-American War and the California Gold Rush, the U.S. government recognized the strategic importance of San Francisco Bay. In 1850, President Millard Fillmore ordered that Alcatraz be set aside for military use.

The West Coast's first operational lighthouse was built on Alcatraz in 1854, guiding the increasing maritime traffic entering the bay. During the Civil War, the island was transformed into a military fortification with some 100 cannons installed to protect San Francisco from Confederate sympathizers and foreign invaders.

By the 1860s, the island began housing military prisoners in a wooden building. The isolation of the island made it an ideal location for detaining prisoners, a purpose that would define its future. The military prison expanded over the decades, housing conscientious objectors during World War I and prisoners from the Spanish-American War.

## Federal Penitentiary Era

The island's most famous chapter began in 1934 when the U.S. Department of Justice acquired Alcatraz from the military and converted it into a federal penitentiary. The prison was designed to house the nation's most troublesome prisoners—those who caused problems at other federal institutions or were considered high escape risks.

Alcatraz gained the reputation as America's premier maximum-security prison, where notorious criminals like Al Capone, George "Machine Gun" Kelly, and Robert Stroud (the "Birdman of Alcatraz") served time. Despite its nickname, Stroud never actually kept birds at Alcatraz; his famous ornithological studies were conducted at Leavenworth before his transfer.

Life on "The Rock" was highly regimented. Prisoners had four basic rights: food, clothing, shelter, and medical care. Anything else was considered a privilege that had to be earned. The prison operated on a principle of "silence"—talking was only permitted during meals and recreation times.

Contrary to popular belief, cells at Alcatraz were not particularly small by prison standards, measuring approximately 5 feet by 9 feet. However, the psychological isolation was profound. From their cells, inmates could sometimes hear sounds from San Francisco—music, laughter, car horns—reminding them of the freedom just 1.25 miles away across the cold waters.

## Famous Escape Attempts

Despite its reputation for being escape-proof due to the cold, strong currents surrounding it, there were 14 escape attempts involving 36 inmates during the federal prison years. Most were caught, several drowned, and five remain unaccounted for, presumed to have drowned in the bay's treacherous waters.

The most famous attempt came in June 1962 when Frank Morris and brothers John and Clarence Anglin meticulously planned an ingenious escape. Over months, they used improvised tools to widen ventilation ducts in their cells, created dummy heads from soap, toilet paper, and real hair to fool night guards, and built a makeshift raft from raincoats. Whether they survived remains one of America's greatest unsolved mysteries, though the FBI officially considers the case unsolved with the men missing and presumed drowned.

## Closing and Native American Occupation

Rising costs and deteriorating facilities led to the prison's closure in 1963. The penitentiary was simply too expensive to maintain, costing nearly three times as much per inmate as other federal prisons.

After the prison closed, Alcatraz gained new significance when Native American activists occupied the island from November 1969 to June 1971. Led by Richard Oakes, a group of 89 Native Americans from various tribes claimed the island under the Treaty of Fort Laramie, which they interpreted as granting unused federal land to Native Americans.

The occupation lasted 19 months and drew international attention to the plight of Native Americans and their fight for self-determination and cultural preservation. Though the occupation eventually ended, it is considered a watershed moment in Native American activism and led to policy changes regarding self-determination for indigenous peoples.

## Alcatraz Today

In 1972, Alcatraz became part of the newly formed Golden Gate National Recreation Area. Today, it is one of San Francisco's most popular tourist attractions, drawing over a million visitors annually.

The National Park Service has preserved many features of the island, including the main cellhouse, dining hall, library, and recreation yard. Visitors can take audio tours narrated by former inmates and guards, providing firsthand accounts of life on "The Rock."

The island has also become an important ecological site. Since human activity has decreased, Alcatraz has become a sanctuary for seabirds, including cormorants, western gulls, and black-crowned night herons. The gardens, originally planted by families of the guards and prison staff, have been restored and feature plants that survived decades of neglect, adapted to the harsh island conditions.

Alcatraz continues to capture the public imagination, featured in numerous films, books, and television shows. Its layered history—from military fortress to federal prison to site of Native American activism to national park—makes it a complex symbol of American justice, resistance, and redemption. The island stands as a stark reminder of our nation's past while offering spectacular views of the San Francisco skyline, a juxtaposition that makes visiting Alcatraz a uniquely American experience.
