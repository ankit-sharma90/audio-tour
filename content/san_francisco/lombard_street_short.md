# Lombard Street

Welcome to Lombard Street, often called "the crookedest street in the world." This famous one-block section between Hyde and Leavenworth streets features eight sharp hairpin turns that zigzag down a steep hill at a 27-degree angle. 

Originally designed in 1922 by property owner Carl Henry, the switchbacks were created to reduce the hill's natural 27% grade, which was too steep for most vehicles of that era. The design allowed residents to navigate the slope safely while creating what would become one of San Francisco's most iconic attractions.

Today, the brick-paved road is lined with carefully manicured flowerbeds bursting with hydrangeas and other ornamental plants that change with the seasons. Elegant Victorian mansions known as the "Painted Ladies" stand watch along the edges, completing the picturesque scene.

Over two million visitors come annually to either drive down the winding road or climb the steps alongside it for spectacular views of the city. From the top, you can see Coit Tower, the Bay Bridge, and on clear days, even Alcatraz Island.

Despite being a residential street, Lombard handles approximately 250 vehicles per hour during peak tourist season. Local residents have learned to live with the constant stream of visitors, though occasional proposals to implement reservation systems or fees have been discussed over the years.

Whether you choose to drive down its curves or admire it from the bottom looking up, Lombard Street represents San Francisco's ability to transform a practical challenge into a whimsical landmark that captures the city's creative spirit.
