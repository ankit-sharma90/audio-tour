# Pier 39

Pier 39, one of San Francisco's most visited attractions, represents the evolution of the city's waterfront from industrial maritime hub to tourism and entertainment destination. This vibrant marketplace welcomes over 15 million visitors annually, offering a blend of shopping, dining, entertainment, and wildlife viewing that has made it an iconic San Francisco experience.

## Origins and Development

Before its transformation, Pier 39 was a simple cargo and fishing pier, one of many utilitarian structures lining San Francisco's Embarcadero. By the 1970s, as shipping technology changed and container terminals moved to Oakland, many of San Francisco's piers fell into disuse and disrepair.

Recognizing an opportunity to revitalize the waterfront, developer Warren Simmons proposed converting Pier 39 into a festival marketplace. His vision was to create a space that celebrated the city's maritime heritage while offering contemporary attractions and amenities. After securing the necessary approvals and overcoming opposition from some environmental and preservation groups, construction began in 1977.

The new Pier 39 opened on October 4, 1978, transforming the aging wooden pier into a colorful, two-level complex of shops, restaurants, and entertainment venues. The development preserved elements of the pier's maritime character, using wooden walkways, nautical decorations, and an open design that maintained views of the bay.

## The Sea Lion Phenomenon

What has become Pier 39's most famous and beloved attraction arrived completely unexpectedly. In January 1990, shortly after the Loma Prieta earthquake of October 1989, California sea lions began hauling out on the floating docks at the marina adjacent to Pier 39. Initially just a few animals appeared, but their numbers quickly grew into the dozens, then hundreds.

Marine experts from the nearby Marine Mammal Center theorized that the sea lions were attracted by the protected environment of the marina, the abundant food supply in the bay, and the absence of natural predators. The marina's boat owners were less than thrilled with their noisy, smelly new neighbors who were taking over the docks.

Faced with this dilemma, Pier 39 management consulted with marine mammal experts and made a surprising decision: rather than trying to remove the sea lions, they would accommodate them. The marina's K-Dock was cleared of boats and designated as a permanent sea lion hangout. This decision proved prescient, as the sea lions quickly became Pier 39's most popular attraction.

The sea lion colony fluctuates seasonally, sometimes numbering more than 1,500 animals. During summer months, many adult males migrate south to breeding grounds in the Channel Islands, while in winter months the population swells. Occasionally, the colony mysteriously disappears entirely for weeks or months—as happened dramatically in 2009—before returning just as suddenly, likely following food sources or responding to oceanic conditions.

The Marine Mammal Center established an educational outpost at Pier 39, the Sea Lion Center, which offers information about these charismatic marine mammals and broader conservation issues affecting marine ecosystems.

## Attractions and Experiences

Beyond the famous sea lions, Pier 39 offers a diverse array of attractions that have evolved over its four-decade history:

### Aquarium of the Bay

This aquarium focuses specifically on the marine life of San Francisco Bay and the surrounding waters. Its signature feature is 300 feet of clear tunnels that pass through 700,000 gallons of carefully maintained bay water, allowing visitors to walk beneath swimming sharks, rays, and other local marine species. The aquarium emphasizes conservation and education about the bay ecosystem.

### San Francisco Carousel

Added in 1998, the San Francisco Carousel is a hand-painted two-story Italian masterpiece featuring 32 animals to ride, many representing endangered species. Unlike traditional carousels, it also includes painted panels of San Francisco landmarks and mythical creatures. Located at the entrance to the pier, the carousel has become a beloved photo opportunity and family attraction.

### Musical Stairs and Street Performers

Interactive musical stairs, installed as part of a renovation in the 2000s, create musical notes as visitors walk on them. Throughout the pier, street performers—jugglers, magicians, comedians, and musicians—entertain crowds, continuing a tradition of public entertainment that dates back to the city's Gold Rush era.

### Shops and Dining

The pier houses over 90 specialty shops and restaurants, ranging from souvenir stands to high-end boutiques. Dining options emphasize seafood, with many restaurants offering outdoor seating with bay views. Pier Market, Neptune's, and the Crab House are among the longstanding establishments serving fresh seafood, while the famous Boudin Bakery offers its signature sourdough bread in the shape of crabs and other sea creatures.

### Magowan's Infinite Mirror Maze

This unique attraction, added in 2009, features a psychedelic labyrinth of mirrors and colored lights that create endless reflections and pathways, challenging visitors to find their way through the disorienting but entertaining space.

### Bay Cruises and Water Activities

From Pier 39's marina, visitors can embark on various bay cruises, including trips to Alcatraz Island, sunset sails, whale watching expeditions, and high-speed thrill rides on RocketBoat. Kayak and paddleboard rentals offer more active ways to experience the bay waters.

## Views and Setting

One of Pier 39's greatest assets is its location and the spectacular views it offers. From various vantage points along the pier, visitors can see:

- The Golden Gate Bridge, especially beautiful at sunset
- Alcatraz Island, with its infamous former prison
- The Bay Bridge, particularly striking when illuminated at night by its LED light installation
- Angel Island, the "Ellis Island of the West"
- The Marin Headlands and the hills of the East Bay
- The San Francisco skyline from a unique waterfront perspective

These views have made Pier 39 a popular photography location and a place where visitors can gain a geographical understanding of San Francisco Bay.

## Cultural Impact and Criticism

Pier 39's development was part of a broader trend in urban waterfront revitalization that occurred across America in the 1970s and 1980s, similar to Baltimore's Inner Harbor, Boston's Faneuil Hall, and New York's South Street Seaport. These projects aimed to transform declining industrial waterfronts into vibrant public spaces and commercial centers.

While undeniably successful as a commercial venture and tourist attraction, Pier 39 has received criticism from some quarters. Local residents sometimes dismiss it as a tourist trap that presents a sanitized, commercialized version of San Francisco that bears little resemblance to the authentic city. Urban planners and preservationists have criticized its festival marketplace format as formulaic and disconnected from the working waterfront's history.

Despite these criticisms, Pier 39 has become an integral part of San Francisco's tourism economy and a significant employer. It has also evolved over time, adding more locally owned businesses and educational components like the Sea Lion Center and Aquarium of the Bay that connect visitors to the natural environment of San Francisco Bay.

## Environmental Considerations

The presence of the sea lions at Pier 39 has raised awareness about marine mammal conservation and the health of San Francisco Bay. The sea lions serve as charismatic ambassadors for marine conservation, and their fluctuating numbers often reflect changing ocean conditions.

In recent years, Pier 39 has implemented various sustainability initiatives, including extensive recycling programs, energy-efficient lighting, and water conservation measures. The Aquarium of the Bay, now operated by a non-profit organization, conducts research and conservation programs focused on the bay ecosystem.

## Legacy and Future

As Pier 39 has passed its 40th anniversary, it continues to evolve while maintaining its core identity as a waterfront marketplace. Recent renovations have updated its appearance while preserving its maritime character. The pier has weathered economic downturns, including the significant impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, demonstrating its resilience as a business model.

Looking forward, Pier 39 faces challenges including adapting to climate change and sea level rise, which pose particular threats to waterfront infrastructure. Plans for the future include enhanced educational components, continued sustainability initiatives, and maintaining the balance between commercial success and authentic connections to San Francisco's maritime heritage.

Whether loved as a joyful waterfront playground or dismissed as a tourist cliché, Pier 39 has undeniably secured its place in San Francisco's cultural landscape. Its transformation from working pier to entertainment destination reflects broader changes in urban waterfronts worldwide and tells a story about how cities reinvent themselves while negotiating the complex relationships between history, commerce, and public space.
