# Alcatraz Island

Alcatraz Island, sitting ominously in San Francisco Bay, holds a fascinating history that spans far beyond its notorious 29 years as a federal penitentiary. Originally named "La Isla de los Alcatraces" (Island of the Pelicans) by Spanish explorers, this 22-acre rock has served multiple purposes throughout American history.

Before becoming a prison, Alcatraz housed the West Coast's first operational lighthouse, built in 1854. During the Civil War, the island was transformed into a military fortification to protect San Francisco Bay, and later became a military prison by the 1860s.

The island's most famous era began in 1934 when it was converted into a federal penitentiary designed to house the nation's most troublesome prisoners. Alcatraz gained the reputation as America's premier maximum-security prison, where notorious criminals like Al Capone, George "Machine Gun" Kelly, and Robert Stroud (the "Birdman of Alcatraz") served time.

Despite its reputation for being escape-proof due to the cold, strong currents surrounding it, there were 14 escape attempts involving 36 inmates. The most famous attempt came in 1962 when Frank Morris and brothers John and Clarence Anglin meticulously planned an ingenious escape using homemade tools and leaving dummy heads in their beds. Whether they survived remains one of America's greatest unsolved mysteries.

After the prison closed in 1963, Alcatraz gained new significance when Native American activists occupied the island from 1969 to 1971, bringing attention to indigenous rights. Today, Alcatraz is one of San Francisco's most popular tourist attractions, drawing over a million visitors annually to experience its haunting history.
