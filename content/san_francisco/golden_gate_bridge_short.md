# Golden Gate Bridge

The Golden Gate Bridge stands as San Francisco's most iconic landmark, spanning the Golden Gate Strait that connects San Francisco Bay to the Pacific Ocean. Completed in 1937, this Art Deco masterpiece was once the longest suspension bridge in the world, stretching 1.7 miles with its distinctive "International Orange" color chosen to complement the natural surroundings and enhance visibility in the bay's frequent fog.

Chief engineer Joseph Strauss led the project, though the elegant design we recognize today came from architects Irving Morrow and his wife, Gertrude. Construction began during the Great Depression, providing much-needed jobs, though the work was dangerousâ€”11 men lost their lives during construction, with 10 of those deaths occurring in a single accident when a scaffold fell.

The bridge's twin towers rise 746 feet above the water, with the roadway suspended 220 feet above the strait. Its construction was an engineering marvel that many experts initially deemed impossible due to the strait's strong currents, frequent fog, and potential for earthquakes.

Today, the Golden Gate Bridge carries approximately 112,000 vehicles daily and has become not just a vital transportation link but a symbol of American innovation and the spirit of San Francisco. Pedestrians and cyclists can enjoy dedicated pathways, offering breathtaking views of the city skyline, Alcatraz Island, and the Pacific Ocean beyond.
