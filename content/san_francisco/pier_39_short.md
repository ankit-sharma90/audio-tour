# Pier 39

Pier 39, one of San Francisco's most visited attractions, began its life as a simple cargo and fishing pier before being transformed into a vibrant waterfront marketplace in 1978. Developer Warren Simmons envisioned creating a unique destination that would celebrate the city's maritime heritage while offering shopping, dining, and entertainmentâ€”a vision that has certainly been realized with over 15 million visitors annually.

The pier's most famous residents arrived unexpectedly in January 1990, shortly after the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake. Sea lions began hauling out on the marina's K-Dock, first in small numbers, then by the hundreds. Marine experts believe they were attracted by the protected environment and abundant food supply in the bay. Rather than removing these boisterous pinnipeds, Pier 39 adapted, converting the boat slips to a permanent sea lion hangout that has become the pier's most beloved attraction. Their numbers fluctuate seasonally, sometimes exceeding 1,500, though they occasionally disappear temporarily when seeking food elsewhere.

Beyond the sea lions, Pier 39 offers a wealth of attractions, including the Aquarium of the Bay, which showcases local marine life through 300 feet of underwater tunnels; the San Francisco Carousel, a hand-painted two-story Italian masterpiece featuring Bay Area landmarks and mythical creatures; and numerous specialty shops and restaurants serving fresh seafood and sourdough bread.

The pier also provides some of the city's most spectacular views, with vistas of the Golden Gate Bridge, Bay Bridge, Alcatraz, and Angel Island. Street performers entertain crowds throughout the day, continuing a tradition of public entertainment that dates back to the city's Gold Rush era.

Despite criticism from some locals who view it as overly commercial, Pier 39 has become an integral part of San Francisco's identity and economy, balancing tourist appeal with genuine connections to the city's maritime heritage and natural environment.
