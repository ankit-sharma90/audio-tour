>If these walls could talk

There is so much history and stories in the places we visit, but we don’t know about them. Learning about the history, myths, and legends about a place make us feel more connected to it. 

### Why I built this
There is no way to learn about the history of a place when being physically present there. I've been both a visitor and local to a landmark, wishing I could understand the detailed history of a place without looking it up on my phone. I wanted to learn without losing the immersion. When I’m exploring a new place, I want to know its stories, so I can feel immersed and understand the place fully. Museums offer audio tours for this exact reason, why not give every interesting place in the world an audio tour?

### Who this is for
If you're curious about whats around you on a deeper level than a one paragraph summary, have a smartphone with you, and have headphones, this app is for you. Plaques and signs aren't enough, and you're willing to go down the rabbit hole and get lost in stories. If you've ever listened to the Alcatraz tour in San Francisco, you know what I'm talking about.

### Key features
1. **Listen** to an audio tour for any of the thousands of popular landmarks in the US (and more places around the world, soon)
2. **Download** audio tours for offline listening, in case you won't have internet access
3. **Choose** between bite-sized 2 minute overviews, or dive into 10 minute immersive sessions
4. **Read** the transcription if you didn't bring headphones or prefer it over audio
