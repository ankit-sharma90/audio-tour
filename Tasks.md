#### Task 1: setup project
- 50 landmarks listed in readme
- only first feature (audio tour)
- webapp to start, then maybe native mobile apps in the future
- placeholders where needed
- want to spend zero (or very little) on tech stack, so use free tiers where possible
- design for mobile web first


#### Task 2: add sample content
- Important: clarify any ambiguity before writing code
- write sample content (text) for each of the landmarks
- also implement any landmarks that don't exist
- write it in english
- have two versions, a 2 minute transcript (by reading time) and a 10 minute read time, for each landmark
- placeholders where needed
- design for mobile web first
- Important: confirm any ambiguity
